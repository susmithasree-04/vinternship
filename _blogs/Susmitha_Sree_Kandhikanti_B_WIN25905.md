When I got selected for an internship at IIT Ropar, I felt excited and curious. At the beginning, I was unsure about how to approach the work and what to expect. As I progressed, I understood that this internship is truly about learning beyond college.

During the internship, I was introduced to MERN stack development and learned JavaScript and TypeScript. These concepts helped me understand how real-world development works, which felt very different from classroom learning. The leaderboard motivated me to stay consistent, discussion forums helped me learn from others, and live stand-up sessions gave structure to my daily work.

One of the most valuable parts of this experience was interaction. I connected with peers from different states through breakout rooms and discussions. These conversations helped me improve my communication, build confidence, and expand my network in ways college alone could not offer.

Balancing college work with the internship was challenging. I managed it by setting small daily goals and working on them consistently. This habit helped me stay focused and move forward without feeling overwhelmed.

This experience shifted how I approach learning. It helped me grow through consistent effort, disciplined work, meaningful collaboration, and confidence in working on real projects rather than focusing only on marks or grades.

I am grateful to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir for his guidance, encouragement, and support throughout this journey. His insights and mentoring played an important role in shaping my learning experience.

This experience shaped how I learn, how I work, and how I see my growth moving forward.
